SimpleAlarm

A simple, handsomely looking alarm clock for Windows.

Easily set the hour and minute to which you want your alarm to
go off at, with the simple up and down arrows above and below
the hours, and minutes.

Set your own alarm, replace the alarm.wav in the Sounds folder
with your own wav file to get a custom alarm sound.

Hit the snooze button to add 5 minutes to the clock and give
you a couple extra minutes of sleep.
